### Background

At Branch, our first value is being passionate about our customers. This includes offering world-class customer service through our in-app chat.

Our customer service agents respond to inbound inquiries using our web-based app. In this project, the challenge is to build a simple mobile version of this app that could be used to respond to customer inquiries while on the go.
