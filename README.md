## \[ 🚧 Work in progress 👷‍♀️⛏👷🔧️🚧 \] Branch Customer Service App 


👀  Writing Branch Customer Service App using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin. 


### Background

At Branch, our first value is being passionate about our customers. This includes offering world-class customer service through our in-app chat.

Our customer service agents respond to inbound inquiries using our web-based app. In this project, the challenge is to build a simple mobile version of this app that could be used to respond to customer inquiries while on the go.
